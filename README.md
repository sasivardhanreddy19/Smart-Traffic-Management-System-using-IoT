# Smart-Traffic-Management-System-using-IoT
The system takes traffic density as input from cameras which is abstracted from Digital Image Processing technique and sensors data, resultantly giving output as signals management. An algorithm is used to predicts the traffic density for future to minimize the traffic congestion.
